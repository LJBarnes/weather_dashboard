# weather_dashboard

A weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions for multiple cities. This application was created using OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data. The purpose of this weather dashboard is so that users can compare the weather in different cities to appropriately plan for travel. 

# How it works

Powered by Jquery, this application uses AJAX to retrieve data in JSON format from OpenWeather API. It then dynamically updates the HTML with the data retrieved from the API to display the city name, an icon depicting the current weather conditions, wind speed, temperature, and humidity.
